# weblog

Testing out [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) for my blog. Currently using the [anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) theme but might make my own later, or tweak this one as it is quite nice.

## Other themes to investigate

* https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge - Lots of [shortcodes](https://abridge.pages.dev/tags/shortcodes/)

## Usage notes

Make a gallery of all images in a folder.

```
{{ gallery() }}
```
