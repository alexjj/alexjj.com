# weblog

Testing out [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) for my blog. Currently using the [anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) theme but might make my own later, or tweak this one as it is quite nice.

## Usage notes

Make a gallery of all images in a folder.

```
{{ gallery() }}
```
