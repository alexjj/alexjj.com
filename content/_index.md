Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex Johnstone. This is my weblog of interesting sundries. I enjoy exploring new things, sometimes I get bored and move on and other things I stick at for a while.

## Now

I'm enjoying undertaking [SOTA](https://gm5alx.uk/sota.html) activations - climbing mountains with my radio - and working my way towards 1,000 points to achieve Mountain Goat status. Also been thinking about rock tumbling.
