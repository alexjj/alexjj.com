Hi! 👋 I'm Alex Johnstone. This is my weblog of interesting sundries. I enjoy exploring new things, sometimes I get bored and move on, and other times I stick at it for a while.

## Now

I’m enjoying being a radio amateur, callsign GM5ALX, and undertaking SOTA activations - climbing mountains with my radio - and working my way towards 1,000 points to achieve Mountain Goat status. I used to play computer games but now I just like the idea of them.
